Sitagliptin is a Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor available for use in Japan for the past few years, and now used in many T2DM patients with low insulin secretory capacity, whose efficacy and safety have been confirmed in many clinical practices. We want then to evaluate sulfonylureas and sitagliptin for the treatment of T2DM in terms of number of discontinuations.
